Problem:									
We weren't able to implement the multiple image upload user story.									
Why 1: Because we started late so we didn't have enough time									
Why 2: Because we took time reviewing how to code web applications									
Why 3: Because it has been a year since we last practiced web programming in class	Why 3 - root cause
Why 4: Because we prefer java development over web development for our class projects									
Why 5: Because it is easier and we have been consistently using it for our classes the last 2 years. 									
Action:									
Practice web development (and other familiar platforms) once in a while by solving problems or creating applications for fun to maintain/improve our programming skills.
